# Welcome to the Automic Solutions Research Repository!

This is where you can access our Research Wiki that describes our past,
current and future areas of research. This is where all of our products
and services originate.

The Wiki includes all technologies we have, are, or will be studying to
understand how they work, how they can be used, and any work we have
done to implement them.

All of this research could be used in future products and services while
some of this research has already directly led to our current line of
products and services.

We hope this will introduce a wide audience to these subjects and spark
ideas for further work to develop products and services we can develop
together.
